# Frontend for Ethereum securities smart contracts

## Running

- `git clone https://github.com/ruchevits/securitieth-frontend.git && cd securitieth-frontend`
- `embark blockchain`
- `embark deploy`
- `meteor`

## Automatic redeployment of contracts

- `cd .gulp && npm install && gulp`

## Current state

Not all contracts are implemented yet as I am still reading on financial instruments and figuring out how they are supposed to work.
